# Pizza Orders API

This is a simple REST API for managing pizza orders using Node.js and Express.
We can get, create, update, and delete pizza orders using this REST API.

## General Instructions

You will need to think about:
- USE MVC folder structure for your API project
  - Here's a sample API for your reference: ```https://github.com/dasingh9/games-api```
- Use dummy data for testing your APIs.
- Test in Postman to make sure all is working correctly.
- Donâ€™t forget to use `.gitignore`, so that the `node_modules` folder is not uploaded to your remote GitHub repo.
- Include a simple README file with instructions on how to start the app locally.
- Keep it simple for yourselves as always. Spend no more than 5 hours on this mini project.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js / npm

### Add these Installation instructions to your README

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pizza-orders-api.git
    cd pizza-orders-api
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the server:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints
